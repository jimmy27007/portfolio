<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I am a Data Analyst with <strong>three years of hands-on experience</strong> working with structured
and unstructured data to support research, business decisions, and policy analysis.
</p>

<p>
My academic foundation in Economics, Mathematics, and Statistics allows me to combine
theoretical knowledge with practical analytical techniques. I specialize in extracting
insights from complex datasets and communicating findings clearly to both technical and
non-technical audiences.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in econometrics, applied statistics, data visualization,
and evidence-based decision-making across economic and business domains.
